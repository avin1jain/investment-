    Fun Facts
  </h2.5> 
  <h3>
   1) All investments carry a level of risk. Most people try to avoid the risk by going for products with guaranteed returns, which more often are scams. Or they put their money in low-risk investments, and just accept the low returns.
  </h3>

  <h3>
   
   2) Investments are like modes of transportation — a bicycle, a car, a bus, a plane, etc. — what you take depends on where you’re going. This means your financial goals will dictate where you should invest.
